## 1. Engineering Identity

**Aaradhya Dev Tamrakar (ADT)** is an undergraduate systems and embedded engineer focusing on the boundary between **hardware-software co-design, near-memory computer architecture, embedded Edge AI, and deterministic verification**.

Rather than treating software development as rapid application scripting, ADT approaches engineering through an **evidence-driven systems paradigm**: specifying formal interface contracts, tracking hardware-level bottlenecks (memory walls, bus contention, interrupt latencies), and deploying zero-token deterministic verification gates to eliminate abstraction drift.

## 3. Four-Tier Status Classification & Technical Proficiencies

Every engineering capability in this dossier is mapped to an explicit status tier defined in [`schemas/evidence-policy.md`](schemas/evidence-policy.md):

```text
[EXPERIMENTALLY_VERIFIED] (E4) ── Physical hardware / public benchmark execution with measured metrics
[IMPLEMENTED]             (E2/E3)── Committed, buildable code with local unit tests / microservices
[RESEARCH_PROTOTYPE]      (E3)   ── Algorithmic or queue-theoretic simulation (SimPy / numerical sweep)
[PROPOSED]                (E0/E1)── Formal architectural specification or schema awaiting empirical test
```

### I. `[EXPERIMENTALLY_VERIFIED]` Domains (Tier E4)
* **Embedded Sensor Kinematics & INT8 Edge AI:** ESP-IDF C/C++ firmware on ESP32-S3 with continuous [200 Hz ISR threshold sampling](report/quantitative-claims-audit.md#1-fall-detection-classification-auc-roc); on-device post-training quantized INT8 neural networks.
* **Statistical Algorithmic Fairness:** Disparity auditing across [[126 demographic bins]](report/quantitative-claims-audit.md#8-intersectional-demographic-bins-audited-biasaperture) evaluating Disparate Impact Ratio and Equalized Odds Difference with BCa bootstrap confidence intervals.
* **Win32 OS & Memory Management:** Direct P/Invoke integration with Windows NT memory APIs (`EmptyWorkingSet`), reclaiming [[1.2 GB – 3.4 GB working-set RAM]](report/quantitative-claims-audit.md#6-working-set-ram-purge-novaoptimizer).
* **Client-Side Cryptography:** Browser-native WebCrypto AES-256-GCM encryption with [[600,000 SHA-256 PBKDF2 rounds]](report/quantitative-claims-audit.md#7-cryptographic-key-derivation-security-parameter).

### II. `[IMPLEMENTED]` Domains (Tier E3)
* **Agentic FastMCP Microservices:** FastMCP JSON-RPC servers in Python for multi-account session aggregation and CAD parametric automation.
* **Deterministic Repository Verification:** AST and regex-based repository auditors ([`sim/reconciliation_engine.py`](sim/reconciliation_engine.py)) enforcing zero-drift consistency across Markdown links, YAML schemas, and metadata headers.
* **Local Web Engines:** High-speed RSVP reading HUDs in Svelte/Vite operating at [[300 – 900 WPM]](report/quantitative-claims-audit.md#9-reading-speed-cadence-rsvp-reader).

### III. `[RESEARCH_PROTOTYPE]` Domains (Tier E3 — Simulation Only)
* **Near-Memory Compute & Bump-in-the-Wire Acceleration:** SimPy discrete-event queueing simulation modeling CXL pooled bus interfaces under burst line-rate ingest.

### IV. `[PROPOSED]` Domains (Tier E1 — Specification)
* **Headless Invariant Assurance:** Neurosymbolic translation of API specifications into SMT-LIB constraints verified via Z3 solvers and Docker execution sandboxes.

## 4. Systems Philosophy

1. **Deterministic Verification over Fragile Abstraction:** If code cannot be verified deterministically via unit tests, SMT solvers, or hardware scope captures, it remains an unverified hypothesis.
2. **Physical Hardware Realism:** High-level abstractions must acknowledge physical silicon bounds—DRAM bus saturation, cache line fills, interrupt jitter, and network packet buffers.
3. **Epistemic Honesty:** Never report simulation results as physical silicon measurements, and never report replacement labor reconstruction as liquid market valuation.
4. **The Three-Output Rule:** Every architectural brainstorm must terminate in at least one of: (1) a reproducible experiment ([`research/experiments/`](research/experiments/)), (2) an executable implementation artifact, or (3) a falsifiable hypothesis card ([`research/hypotheses/`](research/hypotheses/)).
